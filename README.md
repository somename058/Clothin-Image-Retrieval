# Clothing Image Retrieval
The goal of this project is to use image processing to aid in shopping. Our application allows the user to submit a photo of an article of clothing that they are interested in, and that will then return a list of similar items using image retrieval and clustering techniques. This helps the user explore their options and decide exactly what they want.

The  basic features used to classify image are - color, texture, edge/outline, sift features with histogram and Bag-of-words as descriptors.
